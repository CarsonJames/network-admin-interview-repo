#Steps in troubleshooting Problem1:

#1. Log in to Server
#2. Review Ethernet Config
#3. Review /var/log/messages
#4. Determined that server is using DHCP.  In my experience Static IPs should be used for servers.
#5. DHCP renewal taking place every ~30 min.  This would cause connectivity issues.
#6. To resolve, exclude 10.0.0.61/24 from DHCP pool, and assign statically to server.
